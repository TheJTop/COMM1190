So - AI Agents:

So we are familiar with using an AI product, such as AI chat, which we give an instruction in text, and it outputs its result in text format.

AI Agents refer to the process by which an AI model can decide on actions to take and execute them to perform a job.
This is enabled by giving them access to what we call ‘tools.’

So, to add a bit more context.
A tool is an action that the AI Agent can decide to use. The tool defines what an Agentic workflow is capable of, and usually involves some form of retrieving information, or performing some action.

Here, we have some examples – so for example, we can integrate a google search agent, or query a database, or get financial information from yahoo finance and so on.

We see that we start with some trigger event or input that initiates the workflow. The LLM (or AI Agent) then decides which tools, if any, it should then use to complete its task. In the process of completing the task, it could select a tool, which then gives it an observation, and then it makes a new judgement given the observation, to then give an output or to make another tool call.

An example could be Integrating a chatbot with different tools, which we will soon see in the demo video.


P3
So here we have an AI Agent integrated with a chatbot, which has access to a number of tools, including a weather search tool, an internet search tool, as well as a tool that lets it access specific Macquarie documents.

So we can see here that with our first question, it decides to use the weather search function.
Our second question makes it do an internet search.
Our next questions ask it policy related questions, so it calls upon the Macquarie policy tool.

P4
So going back to the diagram – So in summary – an AI agent decides on which tools to call given its unique problem.

Each tool receives information or performs an action, as instructed by the AI Agent.

And then there is also this other step up here, HITL or human in the loop. So if desired, we can make the AI Agent go back to the human to ask for clarification, guidance or feedback at different steps in the process.

P5 
How can we then maximise value from AI Agents?

-	So the low hanging fruit are workflows that fit a couple of key categories. These are workflows that have stable elements, and which are very time consuming, manual, and are very repetitive.

AI Agents are primarily limited by what tools we provide them with.
Some example tools might be Data analysis, drafting and sending emails, text summarisation, translation, and more.
