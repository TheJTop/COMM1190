Welcome to our AI policy chatbot demo.
To first give some context, a policy chatbot is a tool that allows users to ask specific Macquarie policy related questions.

The chatbot knows information found from various documents, including documents found on Macnet and Confluence.

The chatbot can quickly search across multiple documents and data sources, ensuring comprehensive results. The search finds the relevant document sections and returns an AI generated answer to the question.

The benefits are plenty:
To start with, employees struggle to locate and understand various policies without proper guidance and support.
In addition, itâ€™s difficult for policy owners to provide timely assistance to employees in resolving their policy-related issues.
Overall, these combine to be a large time save for both consumer and policy owner.

When a question is put in by the user, it goes through a couple of steps. First, it checks if the question is the same or similar to one of the frequently asked questions in our database. 
This FAQ list has pre-written answers by the policy owners, which it will reply with if the question is similar enough.

For example, these first two questions were found in our database.

At 1 minute:

If the question is not found in the FAQs, then a search across all policy documents in the database is done. The AI first locates the relevant document section, and then generates an answer based off the section and question.

At 1:24 secs
Here, we can see that the AI successfully recognised that the answer to the question would be located in the global brand policy document.

Thankyou.
