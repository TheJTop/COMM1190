Hi everyone, my name is Jordan, and I am a part of the Data and AI – Data Science team.

Here I’m showing off a tech spike I did which allows for people to ask questions in natural language on one or multiple databases, and receive an AI generated Answer.

For those of you who don’t know, a tech spike is a process where we take an idea and see how far we can go in 2 weeks.

This was done in collaboration with the CRE team, who provided us with this data.
--------------------------------------------

To set the scene:
The Corporate Real Estate Team manages around 80 offices, with an annual cost base of $650m.
Additional data insights can lead to greater space utilization – a 1% improvement in space utilization can lead to $2m in savings just in Sydney.

This AI Agent solution attempts to enable users to generate insights in a dynamic and customizable way using unstructured prompts.

Self-service reduces barrier and time to insights, and when fully scaled out can come up with its own insights.

--------------------------------------------
Now onto the demo:

To build this, I used python and OpenAI’s gpt-4o model.

For reference: 
The data contains information on attendance, meeting rooms, desk bookings and more, and is sourced from multiple databases. 

---- *Start Video* ----

To walk through how it works, the user starts by inputting their request into the chat interface. 

So in this example, we are asking ‘what percent of COG were in the Office on average in January.’

This is then taken to a planning agent, which, having knowledge of the data, will come up with steps to complete the task.

The planning agent will then send the first step to the SQL agent, which will turn its requests into an SQL query and make the relevant queries to the database.

Once a step is completed, the planning agent then reviews the results and decides whether to either change the plan, send another request to the SQL agent, or to talk with the user, either to present results or ask a clarifying question.

It’s also important to note that I built this in a very flexible way, meaning this CRE databases could be substituted for a different dataset and be up and running with ease.

At the end of the query, outputted is a table which can be downloaded, and an AI explanation.

*Here we can see the outputted answer of 39.6%, which has been verified as correct by the CRE team.

Thanks for watching!
